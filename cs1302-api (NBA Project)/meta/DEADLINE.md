## Part 1: App Description

> Please provide a firendly description of your app, including the
> the primary functions available to users of the app. Be sure to
> describe exactly what APIs you are using and how they are connected
> in a meaningful way.

> **Also, include the GitHub `https` URL to your repository.**

This app is designed to take any valid NBA player's name and then show
    that players image, team's logo, and general stats (position, height, weight, team).
    This app can also return the same stats for former NBA players but the data may be
    limited from the API it comes from. A total of 3 APIs are used: 1 to display the player's
    image, 1 to display the team's logo, and 1 to display the stats of the player. The APIs are
    connected via the API that returns the player's stats also returns and the abbreviation for the team
    they play on as well as their full name. We use that abbreviation response to get the proper team logo and
    their full name response to get the player's image. This app is also designed to display friendly errors
    when an invalid input is enterned after the getPlayer button is called.

## Part 2: New

> What is something new and/or exciting that you learned from working
> on this project?

I learned from this project how powerful APIs are and how to interpret a JSon
    response and use that information for my program. Something exciting I learned
    also is how many APIs are out there on a variety of topics that can allow us to
    grab all sorts of information to use in our own cretive way.

## Part 3: Retrospect

> If you could start the project over from scratch, what do
> you think might do differently and why?

If I could start the project over from scratch, I would plan the design/ look of my
    application better. I had a general idea of how I wanted it to look before I started
    writing out the code but when it all came together, I felt like it looked boring
    and thought I should have put more thought into the design to make it look more appealing.
