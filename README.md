# NBA_API
This program allows for the user to input the name of any NBA player (current or former) and will display the players image, team logo, as well as some basic stats (height, weight, position).
This program was created in Unix using JavaFX for the graphics and involves Maven for compiling.  
This program accesses 3 APIs: one to retrieve the player's data, one to retrieve the player's headshot, and one to retrieve the player's team logo.
